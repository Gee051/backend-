    "#### Explanation\n",
    "From the above question, we are told to give to give an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.\n",
    "This can be done by first counting the values individually and returning the number of times they appear.. Lets start this journey together\n",
    "Firstly, i created a list of numbers only.. It can be seen in the list above, then i created a variable name called `list_count`(it is an empty distonary), then using the for loop method, i tagged all the values in the list i created below i.e `c in list`. Then using the .get method, i was able to get the number of times each individual value appeared.. Now as you can see i used a dictionary (for list_count) but why? I used a dictionary beacuse .get is a dictionary method and cannot be applied to list or tuples.. Also i wanted to group my work in keys and values.. \n",
    "Note that there are more easier methods to use but i am not fully equipped with advanced processes yet but soon i will.\n",
    "    So now i have gotten how many times each value appear, i want to sort it i.e from the highest to the smallest.. i created a variable name and named it `sorted_list`.I made use of lambda function, i am sure there are other methods but that was the one i could think of.. Now sorted_list equals to my counted values in list_count, sorted using their keys from the highest to the smallest.... normal the function `sorted` sorts values from the smallest to the biggest but `reverse=True` alters that.. i used a for loop in a while loop to combine the `time the value appears` and the number of most frequent element. (for `i` in a) means for every individual value is `a` (remember a is the sorted_list) loop\n",
    "    So i created another variable called `high`.. i used high in the while loop to get the *no of most frequent elements. then using high = high + 1, it increases the number, then it breaks when high is the same as the length of sorted_list.. it prints top (high) most frequent elemnet (i)"

    "#### Alternative method\n",
